# node-lite-F21
A repository for data, notebooks, and exercises for Forge's Fall 2021 Node Lite Course! You can find our course website at https://sjh7yg.gitbook.io/node-lite-f21/. The website has additional information and resources like the slides for each week.

This teaching material was created for one of Forge's 10-week Skills Courses that teach students practical skills. Node Lite focuses on the intro to data science, especially trying to reach those who have no coding experience.
